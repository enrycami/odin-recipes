        <h2>Crepes, a french delight</h2>
        <p>Crepes are a delicacy from France. It's a thin batter that gets cooked to form very flexible, round discs. It can then be filled in a variety of ways, both savory and sweet. And they're super easy to do!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>melted butter</li>
            <li>sugar, optional</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the flour with the eggs and milk with a whisk, trying to avoid any lumps</li>
            <li>Once mixed, add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of sugar, if using it.</li>
            <li>Add the melted butter as well. Note: you could substitute it for vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Let the batter rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This step is not strictly necessary, but very much suggested!</li>
            <li>Heat up a wide non-stick pan and lightly oil it</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan and quickly spread it in a thin layer by moving and rotating the pan itself.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe until it releases on its own, then flip and cook on the other side</li>
            <li>Then remove crepe to a plate and repeat until you have used all the batter</li>
        </ol>
