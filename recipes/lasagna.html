        <h2>What is lasagna?</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a baked pasta dish from Italy. It's comprised of several layers of pasta sheets, alternated with layers of tomato and meat sauce (called ragù in italian) and bechamel, as well as cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pasta sheets</li>
            <li>meat sauce</li>
            <li>bechamel</li>
            <li>parmigiano</li>
            <li>softened butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by buttering your chosen baking dish</li>
            <li>Add a very thin layer of your meat sauce</li>
            <li>Place pasta sheets over the sauce, covering the whole dish</li>
            <li>Spread a bit of bechamel over the pasta, then some sauce over the bechamel</li>
            <li>Add some grated parmigiano</li>
            <li>Place another layer of pasta and repeat the process until you're out of pasta</li>
            <li>Make sure to end with a big dose of parmigiano</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake at 180°C for 50 minutes, uncovering in the last 10 minutes to get a nice crust on top (can also use the grill element of the oven)</li>
            <li>Let cool 10 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
